Jutsu:

- Input filtering customization.


Markov:

- Non-integer markov order: create 2 graph each with the next and previous order, randomly use one of them.
  E.g.: order 2.3 will have 70% of chance to use order 2 and 30% of chance to use order 3 for each step.

- Varying markov order: start low, grow at the middle of the word, finish low. Allow more creative words
  but keep solid root at the middle.



Non-markov generators:

- Just join random element from arrays.
  Generating elvish name is easiest this way: just concatenate an adjective with a suffixe.

- Create "portmanteau" word, created by picking two word randomly from a pool, markov may help joining them.
